# Macaulay Consulting — Site Guide

Static HTML website. No build tools, no frameworks — plain HTML, CSS, and JS, hosted on Cloudflare Pages (primary) and mirrored on GitHub Pages for preview.

Claude Code acts as the CMS: when content needs updating, edit the HTML files directly and push to deploy.

**Source of truth for all page copy:** `content_copy.md`
**Source of truth for SEO metadata:** `seo_metadata.csv`

## Working with this project

**To update content:** refer to `content_copy.md` for the correct copy, then edit the relevant `.html` file directly. When editing a page's content (body copy, headings, links — not just nav, footer, or structural/CSS changes shared across pages), also update `<meta name="last-updated" content="YYYY-MM-DD">` in that page's `<head>` to today's date.

**To add a page:**
1. Create a new `.html` file in the appropriate location.
2. Copy the full header/nav/footer from the nearest equivalent page.
3. Add a link to the new page wherever appropriate — primary nav for top-level public pages.
4. Pages inside `status/` need `../assets/css/style.css` and `../assets/js/main.js` (one level up). Root-level pages use `assets/css/style.css`.
5. Add the new page's path to the `PAGES` array in `status/index.html` so it appears in the status dashboard.
6. Add the new page to `_redirects` if it needs a clean URL (e.g. `/new-page  /new-page.html  200`).
7. Update the file structure listing in this file.

**To update nav or footer:** nav and footer HTML are duplicated across all pages. Update every `.html` file — there is no shared template.

**To show a client logo on the Home page:** place the PNG in `assets/clients/` and set `"confirmed": true` for that client in `clients.json`. The logo filename must match the `logo` field in `clients.json`.

**To deploy:** push to `main`. Cloudflare Pages deploys automatically. Development work goes on a feature branch and is merged via pull request. Never push directly to `main`.

**Clean URLs (external use only):** Cloudflare Pages serves `about.html` at `/about`, `status/index.html` at `/status`, etc., and the `_redirects` file ensures clean paths still resolve. However, **internal site links use relative paths with `.html`** (`about.html`, `services.html`, …), not absolute clean URLs. This is required for GitHub Pages previews and local previews to work, since those don't honour `_redirects`. Reserve clean URLs for things like canonical/og:url meta tags and external references (LinkedIn, business listings).

## Services section structure (as of 2026-05-16)

The Services section uses an overview-plus-detail pattern:

- `/services` — overview page, links out to each service area
- `/services/strategy-and-planning` — strategic planning facilitation for boards and leadership teams
- `/services/co-design` — human-centred design with service users and communities
- `/services/facilitation` — workshop and event facilitation, sector and subject agnostic
- `/services/evaluation-and-research` — qualitative programme evaluation and lived experience research
- `/services/culture` — team culture work; home of the More Joy at Work sub-brand
- `/services/child-and-youth-work` — specialist work with children, young people and the organisations that serve them

The `/more-joy-at-work` page is the More Joy at Work sub-brand page and sits separately from `/services/culture`. Culture is the formal service category; More Joy at Work is the branded programme within it.

Service sub-pages live in the `services/` directory. All paths in their HTML use `../` prefix (e.g. `../assets/css/style.css`, `../index.html`). They are public pages — no `noindex` tag.

When adding new case studies or content, link to the most specific service page that fits. Where two service pages fit equally (e.g. yourtown youth co-design fits both Co-design and Child and Youth Work), link to both, with the more specialised one as primary.

---

## Pre-merge consistency checks

Because nav and footer markup is duplicated across pages, drift is easy. Before merging any PR that touches shared structure (nav, footer, head meta, or anything that should appear on every page), verify:

- **Nav markup is identical** across all 8 pages (`index`, `about`, `services`, `case-studies`, `more-joy-at-work`, `faq`, `contact`, `status/index`). The status page has a slimmed internal nav and uses `../` relative paths — its nav is intentionally different but its footer should match the public pages structurally.
- **Footer markup is identical** across all public pages (links, descriptor, acknowledgement text, copyright year). The status page footer differs only in: (a) `../` relative paths in footer-nav links, and (b) `Internal reference — not for distribution.` copyright suffix.
- **Copyright year** is current and consistent across all pages.
- **Internal links use relative paths with `.html`** (e.g. `about.html`) on the root-level pages. Status page uses `../about.html` style relative paths. No absolute clean URLs in nav, footer, or body links — they break GitHub Pages and local previews.
- **All `<img>` tags have an `alt` attribute** (empty `alt=""` is acceptable for purely decorative images).
- **All external links** carry `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`.
- **Every public page has** `<meta name="description">`, the four core Open Graph tags (`og:type`, `og:url`, `og:title`, `og:description`), and `<meta name="last-updated" content="YYYY-MM-DD">`.
- **Internal-only pages** (`status/`, `visual-identity.html`, `font-options.html`) have `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`.
- **`status/index.html` `PAGES` array** includes every public page (otherwise the status dashboard silently omits it).
- **`_redirects`** has a clean-URL entry for every top-level public page.
- **`seo_metadata.csv` is in sync with the live HTML.** When a page's `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:url` or `<meta name="last-updated">` changes, update the matching row in `seo_metadata.csv` in the same commit. The notes column should call out lengths that exceed search-engine display limits: **title >60 chars** (Google truncates around 55–60) and **description >160 chars** (Google truncates around 155–160). If a length issue can't be fixed in the same change, flag it in the notes column so it isn't lost.

Quick sanity command to spot-check shared blocks:
```
grep -c "footer-descriptor" *.html status/index.html   # should be 1 on every line
grep -c "footer-col-nav"    *.html status/index.html   # should be 1 on every line
grep -E "© 20[0-9]{2}"      *.html status/index.html   # all should be current year
```

When in doubt, diff the nav block (between `<nav` and `</nav>`) and the footer block (between `<footer` and `</footer>`) between `index.html` and each other page — they should be byte-identical for the public pages.

## Effectiveness standards

These principles govern every development and content decision on this site. Macaulay Consulting is a credence-good business (clients cannot easily evaluate quality before engaging), so trust-building is the primary purpose of the website.

### Site purpose and target audience

**Primary purpose:** Convert visitors from health and public sector organisations into enquiries (phone call or contact form).

**Target audience:** Senior leaders, programme managers and procurement decision-makers in Queensland Health, other health agencies, government departments, and community sector organisations. Typically time-poor, risk-aware, and evaluating multiple options.

**Core user scenarios to keep in mind when making any change:**
1. A Health Executive searches for a facilitator for a leadership away-day and lands on the homepage — can they understand what Caroline does, assess her credibility, and find a contact path within 30 seconds?
2. A programme manager who has heard Caroline's name searches for her — does the About page give them enough to advocate for her internally?
3. A potential client on a mobile device wants to get in touch quickly — can they reach a phone number or form within two taps?

---

### Usability standards

- **Navigation must be visible and consistent on every page** — the fixed nav bar satisfies this; do not remove or obscure it.
- **Maximum 3 clicks to contact** — Home → Contact and Home → any service → Contact are the critical paths. Do not add friction.
- **No visible placeholders on public pages** — "coming soon", "under construction", and empty sections signal unprofessionalism and destroy trust. If content is not ready, the section should not be visible to the public. Use HTML comments to hold placeholder notes for internal reference only.
- **No broken links or missing images** — before any deployment, verify all internal links resolve and all `<img>` tags have accessible sources.

---

### Trust signals — what this site must communicate

Consulting is a credence good: clients cannot evaluate quality until after the engagement. The site's job is to make the trust decision as easy as possible across three dimensions:

**Emotional trust** — "I feel comfortable with this person"
- Caroline's headshot is live on the About page (`assets/images/portrait.webp`) and is the page's strongest emotional anchor. Consider adding a smaller version to the Home intro section if a suitable crop is available.
- Testimonials (already present) carry significant weight — add new ones as engagements are completed.
- Workshop imagery (`small-group-session.webp` on Services, `workshop-lead.webp` on More Joy) shows the work in action and supports the editorial visual style.
- The warm, editorial visual style (Cormorant Garamond, parchment tones) signals sophistication and care; maintain this standard in all new sections.

**Rational trust** — "This person has the credentials and track record"
- Credentials section in About is already present — keep it current.
- Case studies are the most underdeveloped trust element; prioritise completing them as Caroline's first content contribution.
- Client logos (once confirmed) provide instant sector credibility — activate them as soon as logo files are available.

**Institutional trust** — "There are structural assurances here"
- A privacy policy page is pending — add it before the site goes live publicly; place a footer link to it on every page.
- Contact details (phone and email) must remain visible in the footer and on the Contact page at all times — they are a structural trust signal.
- The contact form's "not yet active" notice should be removed as soon as the Web3Forms key is in place; a non-functional form is worse than no form.

---

### Interactivity

- The contact form is the primary two-way channel — activating it is a priority.
- LinkedIn is the secondary channel; the link is present in nav and footer on all pages.
- As the business matures, consider adding a simple enquiry-type selector to the contact form (e.g. "What are you enquiring about?" dropdown) to help Caroline triage responses.

---

### Sector-specific guidance

- This is a **B2B consulting** site. Avoid entertainment-oriented features (animations, gamification, decorative interactions). Every feature should serve a utilitarian purpose: helping the visitor find information, assess credibility, or make contact.
- Do not add features that prioritise visual novelty over clarity. Sophistication here means restraint, not complexity.
- When adding new content, ask: does this help a decision-maker trust Caroline enough to pick up the phone? If not, it does not belong on the site.

---

## Code conventions

- **One stylesheet:** `assets/css/style.css` — do not create additional CSS files.
- **CSS custom properties** defined in `:root` — always use them for colours, never hardcoded hex values.
- **JavaScript** goes in `assets/js/main.js` unless a page genuinely needs isolated script (e.g. the status page's fetch logic).
- **No build tool** — header and footer HTML are duplicated across pages. When updating nav or footer, update every page.
- **Relative asset paths** throughout — `assets/css/style.css` not `/assets/css/style.css`. This is required for GitHub Pages subdirectory compatibility.
- **Internal links** use **relative paths with `.html`** (`about.html`, `services.html`, etc.) — not absolute clean URLs. This keeps the site working on GitHub Pages preview (which serves from a subdirectory) and local file:// previews. Cloudflare's `_redirects` still maps `/about` → `/about.html` for any external inbound links using clean URLs.
- **`loading="lazy"`** on all images below the fold.
- **`target="_blank" rel="noopener"`** on all external links.
- **Australian English** spelling throughout all copy (e.g. organisation, programme, practitioner, honour).
- **`<meta name="last-updated">`** must be updated whenever a page's content changes.

## Design system

### Palette
```css
--color-moss:         #2A3B30   /* deep moss — dark sections, nav logo, headings */
--color-moss-dark:    #1E2C24   /* footer background */
--color-parchment:    #FAF7F2   /* page background, hero */
--color-linen:        #F0EAE0   /* alternate section background, card hover */
--color-cumquat:      #E07828   /* brand accent — CTAs, links, highlights */
--color-cumquat-dark: #C4681E   /* hover state for cumquat elements */
--color-cumquat-pale: #FDF0E4   /* pale cumquat — More Joy hero background */
--color-slate:        #5C5248   /* secondary text, labels */
--color-stone:        #DDD5C8   /* borders, dividers */
--color-text:         #1E1A16   /* body text */
--color-text-light:   #5C5248   /* lighter body text (same as slate) */
--color-white:        #FFFFFF   /* nav background, card backgrounds */
--color-error:        #C0392B   /* form validation errors */
```

### Typography
- **Display / headings:** Cormorant Garamond (Google Fonts) — h1–h4, `.footer-logo`, `.nav-logo`, large pull quotes
- **Body / UI:** Lora (Google Fonts) — body copy, nav links, buttons, labels, captions
- Google Fonts URL: `https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Cormorant+Garamond:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,600;0,700;1,300;1,400;1,600;1,700&family=Lora:ital,wght@0,400;0,500;0,700;1,400;1,500;1,700&display=swap`

### Heading sizes
```css
h1 { font-size: clamp(40px, 6vw, 68px); line-height: 1.08; }
h2 { font-size: clamp(28px, 4vw, 44px); line-height: 1.1;  }
h3 { font-size: clamp(20px, 2.5vw, 28px); line-height: 1.15; }
```
Italic (`<em>`) inside headings renders in cumquat (`--color-cumquat`).

### Section backgrounds
- `.bg-parchment` → `#FAF7F2`
- `.bg-linen` → `#F0EAE0`
- `.bg-moss` → `#2A3B30` (text overrides: headings → parchment, p → 85% parchment)
- `.bg-cumquat-pale` → `#FDF0E4`

### Section label (eyebrow text above headings)
```html
<span class="section-label">Label text</span>
```
Rendered in cumquat, italic Lora, 13px, uppercase letter-spacing.

### Buttons
- **Primary:** `.btn-primary` — cumquat background, white text, Lora 700, 15px, `padding: 14px 28px`, border-radius 3px
- **Text link:** `.btn-text-link` — inline, bottom border, cumquat on hover
- **Arrow link:** `.arrow-link` — cumquat, bold, gap animates on hover (`gap` transitions from 6px → 12px)

### Navigation
- White background, fixed, `height: 72px` (`--nav-h`)
- Adds `border-bottom: 1px solid var(--color-stone)` on scroll (`.scrolled` class)
- Nav links: Lora 15px, underline scale-in on hover/active
- LinkedIn icon sits at end of desktop nav, suppresses underline effect
- Mobile: hamburger (`.nav-hamburger`) at 860px, opens fullscreen moss overlay (`.nav-mobile`)

### Footer
- Background: `--color-moss-dark` (`#1E2C24`)
- Three-column grid (`.footer-grid`, `1.4fr 1fr 1.4fr`):
  - `.footer-col-brand` — wordmark, `.footer-descriptor`, `.footer-contact` (email + phone), `.footer-affiliation` ("Member of the Clarity Consortium")
  - `.footer-col-nav` — `.footer-col-label` ("Navigate") + `.footer-nav` list (About, Services, How it works, Case Studies, More Joy at Work, FAQ, Contact)
  - `.footer-col-acknowledgement` — `.footer-col-label` + `.footer-acknowledgement`
- Folds to 2 columns at 900px (acknowledgement spans full width), single column at 620px
- `.footer-bar` at bottom: flex, `justify-content: space-between`
  - Left: `.footer-copy` (copyright)
  - Centre: `.footer-li` (LinkedIn icon, public pages only)
  - Right: `.footer-updated` — injected at runtime by `main.js` from `<meta name="last-updated">`

### Testimonial carousel (`.t-carousel`)
- Slides fade in/out with JS; dots navigate manually. JS finds slides/dots via `querySelectorAll`, so any slide count works.
- On moss background: white quote text, stone attribution
- Carousels appear inside a `.t-single` section wrapper (legacy class name retained). The Services page uses `.t-single-inner` for a static single-quote layout; Home and More Joy use `.t-carousel` inside the same wrapper.

### Cards
- Workshop cards (Home): white bg, stone border, `border-radius: 4px`, lift on hover (`translateY(-4px)`)
- Services snapshot (Home): flex column, large muted number, cumquat arrow-link
- All card grids use CSS Grid — do not use `translateY` for visual stagger as it breaks perceived height alignment

---

## Navigation

### Primary nav (in order)
1. Home → `/`
2. About → `/about`
3. Services → `/services`
4. How it works → `/how-it-works`
5. Case Studies → `/case-studies`
6. More Joy at Work → `/more-joy-at-work`
7. FAQ → `/faq`
8. Contact → `/contact`
9. LinkedIn icon → external, `target="_blank" rel="noopener"`

### Footer nav
Three-column footer: brand column (logo, descriptor, email, phone, Clarity Consortium affiliation), Navigate column (mirrors primary nav minus Home: About, Services, How it works, Case Studies, More Joy at Work, FAQ, Contact), and Acknowledgement of Country column. Bottom bar carries the copyright, LinkedIn icon (public pages only), and the runtime-injected "Updated [date]".

### Internal reference pages (not in nav)
- `/visual-identity` — living style guide, links to live stylesheet
- `/status` — live-fetch status dashboard (noindex)

---

## Client logos

`clients.json` is the source of truth for the clients grid on the Home page.

Each entry:
```json
{
  "name": "Organisation Name",
  "logo": "filename.png",
  "sector": "health|government|community",
  "tier": "featured|standard",
  "confirmed": false
}
```

- `confirmed: false` → renders organisation name as text placeholder
- `confirmed: true` → renders the image from `assets/clients/[logo]`

Logo files can be `.png`, `.svg`, `.webp` or `.jpg` (current folder mixes all four). Square or landscape, transparent or white background, greyscale or dark colour preferred — CSS applies `filter: grayscale(1) opacity(0.6)` which lifts on hover.

---

## SEO

**Source of truth for SEO metadata:** `seo_metadata.csv` — one row per page. Update this file at the same time as editing a page's `<head>` meta tags.

### Meta tags — every page needs
- `<meta name="description">` — unique per page, 150–160 characters
- Open Graph: `og:type`, `og:url`, `og:title`, `og:description` (the four currently present on every page)
- `<meta name="last-updated" content="YYYY-MM-DD">` — update when content changes
- Internal reference pages also need: `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`

`og:image` is **not** currently set on any page. When a canonical preview image is ready (a wide crop of `portrait.webp` or a workshop image with the wordmark, hosted at a stable URL), add it to every page's `<head>` so social link previews on LinkedIn, Facebook and Slack render with a visual.

---

## Pending / placeholders

- [x] **Logo artwork — horizontal nav lockup** — `assets/logos/cm-consulting-logo-horizontal.png` (RGBA, transparent background) is live in the nav on all pages.
- [ ] **Logo artwork — footer/dark variant** — the current horizontal logo is dark green and orange, so it disappears on the footer's moss-dark background. Footer still uses the text wordmark. Needs a parchment/cream version on transparent background (RGB green is `42, 59, 48` / `#2A3B30`; orange is `#E07828`).
- [x] **Headshot** — `assets/images/portrait.webp`, live on About page
- [x] **Site imagery** — `small-group-session.webp` (services), `workshop-lead.webp` (More Joy), `your-town-engagement-strategy.webp` (case studies) are live
- [ ] **Web3Forms key** — enter `caro@consultcm.com.au` at web3forms.com, paste key into `contact.html`, remove `onsubmit="return false;"` and the "not yet active" notice
- [ ] **Case study content** — West Moreton Health and yourtown are drafted with attributed testimonials; both need Caroline's confirmation of the situation/approach/outcome detail before publishing. 2 further placeholder slots remain in `case-studies.html` (HTML comments) for additional case studies.
- [ ] **Client logos** — PNG files for confirmed clients go in `assets/clients/`; set `"confirmed": true` in `clients.json` per client
- [ ] **More Joy at Work programme phases** — Caroline to review phase names, sequence and descriptions in `more-joy-at-work.html`
- [ ] **Video embed** — add YouTube/Vimeo URL in `more-joy-at-work.html` once content is published; replace the placeholder block
- [ ] **`og:image` for link previews** — no canonical preview image is set. Choose one (wide crop of `portrait.webp` or a workshop image with the wordmark), upload to a stable URL, and add `<meta property="og:image" content="...">` to every public page's `<head>`.
- [ ] **Google Business Profile** — set up once `consultcm.com.au` is live
- [ ] **Social links beyond LinkedIn** — add if/when other channels are established
